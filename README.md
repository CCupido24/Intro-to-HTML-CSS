# Intro-to-HTML-CSS
This course teaches HTML, the foundation of website and web app development, and semantic markup, which ensures content is understandable to both humans and computers. It covers fundamental syntax, content formatting, image incorporation, hyperlinks, global attributes, navigation menus, content organization, interactive forms, and data tables. This helps improve web accessibility for differently abled individuals.

Week 1 Uint 1: Intoduction to HTML
•	HTML is a crucial component in web technology, serving as a channel for various content types such as words, images, videos, audio, forms, and interactive experiences. 
•	It forms the foundation for all digital realms. The internet serves as a meeting point between human and computer languages, as websites are programmed and consumed by people or other computers. 
•	Artificial intelligence aims to enable computers to intelligently comprehend human activities. HTML is designed to bridge the gap between human and computer languages, allowing us to structure content and bridge the gap between human and computer languages.
•	The Web relies on three programming languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, each with its unique role. Developers combine these languages to achieve resilience, robustness, and power in their websites. They use the more robust features of these languages and use the remaining parts to enhance the site. HTML is preferred for tasks that can be done in HTML, while other languages are used if necessary. Learning all the elements and attributes of HTML is essential to fully benefit from its capabilities.

Week 1 Unit 2: HTML Text Formatting
HTML Paragraphs 
•	HTML is a language for structuring web pages. It distinguishes between elements by using tags surrounded by less-than and greater-than marks. Tags occur in two varieties: opening tags and closing tags. A paragraph's opening and ending tags are <p> and </p>, respectively.
•	This course explores the use of HTML elements, which are packages containing content. Some elements, like paragraphs, require both an opening and a closing tag, while others do not. The purpose of HTML markup is to provide meaning to content and help computers understand it. It serves as a bridge between humans and computers. An example is a short paragraph with emphasized text wrapped in p tags. An emphasized phrase is turned into a separate element using em tags. HTML elements can be nested within one another, enhancing their functionality.
•	An HTML document is a collection of HTML elements nested within each other, creating a tree structure like a family tree. This structure is called a DOM tree, or Document Object Model, and is crucial for working with CSS, JavaScript, and developers. 
•	The DOM tree also creates an accessibility tree, which impacts the user experience on a website, including those with disabilities.The choice of HTML elements significantly impacts the user experience on a website.
•	It's crucial to consider the placement of HTML tags and how elements are nested within each other to convey content and interfaces effectively.

HTML HeadLines
•	Headlines are essential elements in web pages, dividing lengthy text into smaller, more digestible chunks. 
•	They are found everywhere and act as clickable titles on landing pages. Headlines come in six different types: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6. Each headline has a distinct visual effect and conveys a sense of hierarchy in how the browser interprets and communicates about the page. The h1 element is the largest and most prominent, while h6 is the smallest and least attention-grabbing.
•	Selecting the appropriate headline level is generally straightforward, starting with the opening tag (e.g. h1) and ending with the closing tag. However, determining the most suitable level of headline can be challenging at times.
•	Although there isn't a set formula, using these six stages can significantly improve the organization and consistency of your content. The six tiers of headline possibilities give you the freedom to choose when and how to use them to create a semantic hierarchy.
HTML Bold and Italics
•	HTML contains four components that allow us to mark text as bold or italics. Two of them, "<em>" and "<strong>", transmit meaning and fulfill a linguistic purpose. The other two, "<i>" and "<b>", do not have any specific purpose and are only used for visual design.

HTML Lists
•	Lists are integral to our daily lives, including to-do lists, recipes, wish lists, and bucket lists. However, they are more prevalent on the internet, often appearing in navigation bars or landing pages with captivating content. 
•	In HTML, there are three types of lists: unordered lists, ordered lists, and definition lists. These lists can be found in various formats, such as navigation bars and landing pages.
•	Unordered lists are the most common type of list, such as a recipe list of ingredients. Each item is enclosed in an <li> element, with a dot or marker before it. To define the entire list and specify its type, all items are wrapped in an <ul> element, representing an unordered list.
•	A definition list, also known as a "description list" in HTML, is a type of list used in computer science to create a key-value pair. It consists of terms and their corresponding descriptions, enclosed in tags. 
•	The term or key is enclosed in a tag, while the description or value is enclosed in a tag. Multiple descriptions can be provided for each term using multiple tags. The entire list is wrapped in a tag, representing the definition list. The tags and tags are placed side by side without any additional wrapper, illustrating the structure of a definition list.
  
HTML Quotes
•	The HTML <blockquote> element defines a section that is quoted from another source.
•	The HTML <abbr> tag defines an abbreviation or an acronym, like "HTML", "CSS", "Mr.", "Dr.", "ASAP", "ATM".
•	Marking abbreviations can give useful information to browsers, translation systems and search-engines.
Tip: Use the global title attribute to show the description for the abbreviation/acronym when you mouse over the element.

HTML Date and Time Inputs
•	HTML simplifies programming by using a single element called <time> to mark specific moments or ranges in time, such as a time of day, date, or duration. The <time> element consists of an opening tag (<time>) and a closing tag (</time>) and can be used in any human-readable format for the text between the tags. The main purpose of the <time> element is to convey the exact date or time to computers, which is achieved using an HTML attribute called "datetime."
•	The datetime attribute allows us to specify the date or time in a format that computers can understand, such as <time datetime="2025-05-08">May 8, 2025</time>. The format of the time within the datetime attribute must be specific, as dates and times have a special format that machines can understand. For example, May 8th is represented as 05, 08. The machine-readable version of the datetime attribute starts with the year, four digits, followed by the month in two digits, and the date in two digits.
•	The datetime attribute allows for the combination of date and time in HTML. It includes the date and time, separated by a space or a T. Machine-readable time formatting rules are acceptable and correct, applicable to many programming languages. There are numerous combinations to use, so it's important to research them when needed. The time element with its datetime attribute allows for the conveying of time in a way that computers can understand.

HTML Code, pre and br
•	To showcase code on a webpage, use the code element to create a monospaced font and style it with a monospaced font. By default, code is treated as an inline element, meaning it remains part of the sentence. To change the word "H4" into an actual H4 headline, use an HTML entity like "&lt;" or "&gt;". This will display a less than sign and a greater than sign respectively.
•	For example, if we want to display HTML code on a page instead of executing it, we can use the br and pre-elements. The br element is a simple tag without an opening or closing tag, indicating where a line break should occur. It does not contain anything inside it but indicates where a line break should happen.
•	When writing code, we can add as many spaces and line breaks as we want, and the browser will ignore them. However, if we want to show those spaces and line breaks, we can use the br element at the end of each line. This will make the poem look correct and make it more readable without affecting the webpage's content.
•	In summary, using the br and pre-elements can help showcase code on a webpage, making it more readable and visually appealing.
•	The combination of pre and code elements is common for displaying a code block with proper indentation. In HTML, indentation is added to make it easier to understand. CSS code is also indented. The entire code is wrapped in a code element to indicate it's a block of code, while a pre-element preserves formatting and spacing. These three elements are essential for conveying the structure and appearance of code and other content types.

HTML Superscripts, Subscripts and Small Text
•	Subscripts, superscripts, and small text are used in HTML to mark-up specific parts of content with different meanings. Subscripts are characters set below the normal baseline for text, like the formula for water, H2O. Superscripts are characters set above the normal baseline, like mathematical formulas or footnote markers.
•	To mark-up subscripts and superscripts, use the sub and sup elements. For example, to format H2O as a footnote, wrap the two characters in its sub-element and drop them below the baseline. For superscripts, wrap the two characters in sup, jump up higher, and get smaller. This is how to handle subscripts and superscripts in HTML with the sub and sup elements.
•	MathML is a powerful markup language for math that can be used to mark complex equations on websites. It is also useful for indicating small text that is not as important but still needs to be included. For example, copyright information can be placed in the footer of a page, and a small element can be used to convey its low prominence.
•	CSS can adjust the size of text to any desired size, large or small. However, small text can be used to convey that something has very little prominence, like the fine print at the bottom of a page regarding ownership of the content. This text can be conveyed to the browser as "Hey, this is the fine print. " It is not the main attraction. 
•	Small, sub, and sup elements can help in typography and convey the full meaning of your content.
